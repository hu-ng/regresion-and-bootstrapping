# Regression and Boostrapping in R

For an assignment in my Causal Inference course, I used R to achieve the following things:

- Run linear regression models.
- Use simulation to generate estimates for expected and predicted (expected + error terms) values, along with confidence intervals.
- Bootstrap to estimate a confidence interval for a coefficient of a regression model.
- Plot graphs, from histograms to ones with confidence intervals.

To run the code:

- Have RStudio installed.
- Clone the repo and open `code.R`.
- (Optional) Import the included workspace.
- Execute the file.
