# Regression and Boostrapping in R

# Discussion:

For an assignment in my Causal Inference course, I used R to achieve the following things:

- Run linear regression models.
- Use simulation to generate estimates for expected and predicted (expected + error terms) values, along with confidence intervals, using the `sim` function from the `arm` library.
- Bootstrap from scratch (without using the `boot` function) to estimate a confidence interval for a coefficient of a regression model.
- Plot graphs, from histograms to ones with confidence intervals.

# Instructions:

Have RStudio installed.
Clone the repo, navigate to the repo folder, run `code.R`. (Optional) Import the included workspace before running the file.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hu-ng/regresion-and-bootstrapping.git
$ cd regresion-and-bootstrapping
$ code.R
```
